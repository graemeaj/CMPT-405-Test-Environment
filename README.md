## Living-Labyrinth
# Overview
Living Labyrinth is a virtual reality horror game that uses biometric feedback to change the environment of a spooky dungeon. It was my computer science capstone project, done by myself and Dylan Melicano under the supervision of Dr. Regan Mandryk at the University of Saskatchewan Human-computer interaction lab.

# Description
Uses an oculus DK2 HDM and the lightstone biofeedback device to measure galvanic skin response, which is increased due to fear. When the fear level goes above baseline, the walls will change colour, sounds will change and enemies will be able to see you from farther away.

# Why
We built this to get into VR development and we thought that a biofeedback device in a horror game would be an insteresting combination of technologies. I ended up pursuing VR development as a profession because of this project.
